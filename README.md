# Pre-requisites

1. Install Python 3.11 and set it up
2. Install libraries used in each respective script. If you dont have it installed, the error will direct you to the missing package. You just need to install that using pip or other package managers. Some commonly used packages in this repo include:
```
pip install tqdm
pip install tkinter
pip install pymediainfo
```
3. Scripts which automate functions from other repos should have their unique dependencies and requirements met.
4. Enjoy~
