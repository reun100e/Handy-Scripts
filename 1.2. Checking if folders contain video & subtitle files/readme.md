# 1.2 Checking if folders contain video & subtitle files

Now lets say you needed to check if all folders contain a .mp4 file. Then use this script:
```
python check_folders_for_mp4.py
```
Or use this script which is the same script in steroids. It checks for all video and subtitle files, and exports a txt file with results. Extremely useful when you got huge data to work with.
```
python check_folders_for_videos_and_subtitles.py
```
