# 1.5 Sort photos and videos in to separate folders by date

Now lets say you have imported all photos from phone or camera and everything is in one single folder or you have nested folders of the same. You want to sort all your photos and videos in to separate folders based on date taken. This script helps you accomplish exactly that:

```
python sort_media_by_date_taken.py <your media folder directory>
```
